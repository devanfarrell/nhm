                                | He has sent me to tell those who mourn that the time of the Lord's favor has come, and with it, the day of God's anger against their enemies.
                                | To all who mourn in Israel, he will give a crown of beauty for ashes, a joyous blessing instead of mourning, festive praise instead of despair.
                                | In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks that the Lord has planted for his own glory.

                            | They were made to kill others in order to survive.
                            | Those that were not kidnapped were put into displaced person camps with their families.
                            | These camps were meant to house 5-6 families but ended up housing 50-60,000 people.
                            | The conditions were unsanitary, overcrowded and they did not have enough food.
                            | The children had to walk miles every night to sleep in a safe place, so they would not be kidnapped.
                            | JB and his sister were able to escape from the rebels after eight months time.
                            | His family then sent him to the southern part of the country where it was safe.

                            | About this time the Lord began to speak to his heart of returning home to northern Uganda to preach the good news to the Acholi people, so that they also might experience the love of God in their life.
                        p
                            | In September 2010, JB and his wife went home to northern Uganda to begin building Calvary Chapel Pajule and finalize their plans to relocate there.

                            | They returned to the village lifestyle of no running water, no electricity, and poverty everywhere you look.
